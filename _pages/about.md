I was born in Athens and grew up in a small town called [Nafplio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafplio){:target="_blank"}. I received my Ph.D from the Department of Informatics, Athens University of Economics and Business, in June 2009. Before joining Sussex as a Lecturer in 2013, I was a Research Associate at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge.

I am a Professor of Computer Networks at the School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex. My University profile is [here](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p334868-george-parisis){:target="_blank"}.

My research is in the following research areas:

* network protocol design
* network management
* network verification
* opportunistic networks
* information-centric networks

I am always interested in supervising talented students who want to do a PhD at the University of Sussex ([Brighton](https://www.visitbrighton.com/){:target="_blank"} is also an excellent place to live). We sometimes offer scholarships to exceptional students. Feel free to send me unofficial enquiries about PhD topics but you need to officially apply [here](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/apply){:target="_blank"}.
